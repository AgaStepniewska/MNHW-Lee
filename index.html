			<h2><hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" /> About Us <hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" /></h2>
			<p><span>Merton Neighbourhood Watch (NHW) is a community run scheme, supported by the Police, which helps cut crime and incidences of Anti Social behaviour.</span><br><br>
			Neighbourhood Watch has been around since 1982 and is the largest voluntary movement in the UK. When active, Neighbourhood Watch has been proven to reduce crime and the fear of crime in local neighbourhoods. Initially set up to tackle burglary, it now covers a whole range of crime and anti-social behaviour as well as helping to build that all-important sense of neighbourhood.<br><br>
			Neighbourhood Watch is not about being nosey or gossiping; it is about developing local knowledge, building community spirit and developing links with your local policing team.<br><br>
			Managed one day a week by a Safer Merton officer and overseen by a Committee made up of volunteer co-ordinators, we have a good working relationship with Merton police who provide us with office space at Mitcham Police Station. We are self funded as we receive no official funding
			If you are interested in joining Neighbourhood Watch complete the <a href="assets/documents/Interest form.doc">application form.</a>

			<h2><hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" />Benefits of Neighbourhood Watch<hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" /></h2>
			<p>Being part of an active community who are looking out for one another provides reassurance and peace of mind, whether to those who live alone and feel isolated or those concerned about leaving their home unoccupied while on holiday.<br><br>
			The aim of Neighbourhood Watch is to bring neighbours together to create strong, friendly, active communities where crime and anti-social behaviour are less likely to happen. Residents are encouraged to report all incidents and suspicious behavior to the relevant agencies to try and help prevent crime before it happens.

			<h2><hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" />Neighbourhood Watch<br>Co-ordinators<hr style="width:10%;border-top:1px solid black" /></h2>
			<p>As a co-ordinator you are the link between your community, the local police teams and the neighbourhood watch manager. Ideally there will be at least one co-ordinator per watch.<br><br>
			Being a co-ordinator will not take up a lot of your time but can have a big impact on your local community. The role is what you make it. We will send you information on crimes taking place in and around your local area as well as crime prevention tips. Please take a look at the <a href="assets/documents/NHW co-ordinator JD 2015.doc">Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator job description</a> which details some of the things you may do in your role - we fully appreciate that time is precious so we stress the minimum we ask is that you forward crime information to your members (which we will provide).<a href="#crimeFigure">Crime Figure</a><br><br>
			We also encourage you and your watch to report all incidents and suspicious activity to the relevant agencies. If you see something that may help the Police in solving or preventing a crime, make a note of what you have seen and pass this information on to the Police. If you have an emergency, where a crime is happening now, there are suspects on scene or there is danger to life you should call 999. For crimes that are not urgent you should call 101.
			</p>
			<h3>What happens once I am a Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator?</h3>
			<p>Once your watch has been set up, you will receive members packs for yourself and your neighbours. These include a welcome letter which informs them that you are the new Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinator, a Neighbourhood Watch window sticker and information booklets. We encourage Neighbourhood Watch Co-ordinators to get their watch email addresses so they can forward relevant emails from the Police and Neighbourhood Watch to them.
			Please contact us if you would help to do this.<br><br>
			Neighbourhood street signs for lampposts are available for Co-ordinators and members to put up to indicate an active watch is operating in your road, street or block of flats. Co-ordinators can erect the signs themselves following approval by Merton council (or the relevant owner of the lamppost). If you would like to order a street sign please see <a href="assets/documents/Street sign request form.doc">request a street sign</a> <br><br>
			Neighbourhood Watch Co-ordinators are invited to attend our AGM and other events throughout the year; however, itâ€™s worth noting that attendance at these events is not mandatory.
			</p>
